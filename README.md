[Laravel Vapor](https://vapor.laravel.com) is an auto-scaling, serverless deployment platform for Laravel, powered by AWS Lambda. Manage your Laravel infrastructure on Vapor and fall in love with the scalability and simplicity of serverless.

Vapor abstracts the complexity of managing Laravel applications on AWS Lambda, as well as interfacing those applications with SQS queues, databases, Redis clusters, networks, CloudFront CDN, and more.

This package provides a beautiful dashboard accessible via your Vapor application that allows you to view / search your application's logs and failed queue jobs. To learn more about Vapor and how to use this dashboard, please consult the [official documentation](https://docs.vapor.build/1.0/introduction.html#installing-the-vapor-ui-dashboard).
