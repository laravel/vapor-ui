# Laravel Vapor UI

[Laravel Vapor](https://vapor.laravel.com) is an auto-scaling, serverless deployment platform for Laravel, powered by AWS Lambda. Manage your Laravel infrastructure on Vapor and fall in love with the scalability and simplicity of serverless.

Vapor abstracts the complexity of managing Laravel applications on AWS Lambda, as well as interfacing those applications with SQS queues, databases, Redis clusters, networks, CloudFront CDN, and more.

This package provides a beautiful dashboard through your application with a variety of metrics across all of your AWS resources. To learn more about Vapor and how to use this dashboard, please consult the [official documentation](https://docs.vapor.build).
